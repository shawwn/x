GENERAL

	time can be sped up or slowed down, and paused


	fixed portals that can be traveled between, and the ability to make temporary ones
	temporary portals decay after some time, becoming unstable before they disappear
	unstable portals lead to a random place near the portal, the more unstable the wider the range
	unstable portals emit a burst of damage, the more unstable the bigger
		so if you have bad luck and a super unstable portal teleports you exactly on itself, you're toast
		otherwise,
